Bitmond like every other crypto currency works as a decentralized network which consists of
peers that can run independently of each other in other words the power to transmit information
is distributed among a network of servers, instead of being driven from one primary source.

This means that the Bitmond network does not depend on any single entity. The idea is to have
as many independent servers participate in the Bitmond network as possible, so that the network
will still run successfully even if some servers fail
